# ballast-model-great-lakes
This model code describes ballast-water movement of aquatic nonindigenous species (NIS) by domestic shipping vessels in the Laurentian Great Lakes basin (GLB), as used in Chenery et al., 2019. The model was previously formulated and published as part of Drake et al. (2015) project completion report to the Great Lakes Fishery Commission, on the secondary spread of aquatic NIS via ballast water and recreational boating, and is shared here with permission of the authors.

Also included are three text files containing essential shipping and NIS density information used in the model (Drake et al., 2015).

The code is split into two parts: 1) model setup and 2) simulation and plotting.
